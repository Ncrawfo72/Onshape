TEAM WOEK MAKES THE DREAM WORK:

The assignment was basically making a tiny little spinner that uses a pull stick to spin a little spinner.

The prop was pretty difficult for me it wasnt very easy as it had so many things that I had no idea about how to do. My partner helped quite a bit cause I got stuck on multiple parts of the assignment. Getting the right weight was also a pretty difficult thing. Also I ended up making every blade a different part and that would never get fixed.

SWING ARM:

This assignment was basically taking mesurments from an onshape assignment and createing the thing diemensioned in the documents and actually making it in onshape.

This assignment was also pretty difficult I found hard to get the right measurments and make the the whole thing diemensioned and make able to be extruded. It was also pretty hard to get the right weights for the swing arm. I ended up getting help from class mates who helped me get the correct dimensions and weight.
