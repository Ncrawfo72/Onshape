Teamwork Makes the Dream work

The assignment was basically making a tiny little spinner that uses a pull stick to spin a little spinner.

It was kinda a hard project mainly cause there were so many new things I haven't done before. My teamate found it much easier than I did and ended up helping me a fair amount cause I had the harder part of the two. I was able to do it, but had to basically redo most of it with help from my teamate as I didnt get the correct weights at first.
