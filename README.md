TEAM WOEK MAKES THE DREAM WORK:

The assignment was basically making a tiny little spinner that uses a pull stick to spin a little spinner.

The spinner part was actually kinda easy or I thought it was it was the easier part of the the 2 parts I made. This is probably because it was a pretty straight forward and had things I new how to do unlike the prop. I defenintley didnt need as much help as I need on the prop or on other assignments.


PROP:

The prop was pretty difficult for me it wasnt very easy as it had so many things that I had no idea about how to do. My partner helped quite a bit cause I got stuck on multiple parts of the assignment. Getting the right weight was also a pretty difficult thing. Also I ended up making every blade a different part and that would never get fixed.

SWING ARM:

This assignment was basically taking mesurments from an onshape assignment and createing the thing diemensioned in the documents and actually making it in onshape.

This assignment was also pretty difficult I found hard to get the right measurments and make the the whole thing diemensioned and make able to be extruded. It was also pretty hard to get the right weights for the swing arm. I ended up getting help from class mates who helped me get the correct dimensions and weight.

MULTI PART STUDIO:

This assignment was basically the same as the swing arm except taking measurments from paper and making them into parts that work with one another.

This is the only one of these assignments that I actually enjoyed doing and actually enjoyned making it was pretty straight forward and I was able to understand it on my own without major help form piers. I struggled on making some of the parts not just one big part, but besides that I was able to really do pretty well on it. I did however do half the project with my plunger upsidedown and had to spend a day flipping it back over which I struggled heavily with.
