TEAM WOEK MAKES THE DREAM WORK:

The assignment was basically making a tiny little spinner that uses a pull stick to spin a little spinner.

It was kinda a hard project mainly cause there were so many new things I haven't done before. My teamate found it much easier than I did and ended up helping me a fair amount cause I had the harder part of the two. I was able to do it, but had to basically redo most of it with help from my teamate as I didnt get the correct weights at first.

SWING ARM:

This assignment was basically taking mesurments from an onshape assignment and createing the thing diemensioned in the documents and actually making it in onshape.

This assignment was also pretty difficult I found hard to get the right measurments and make the the whole thing diemensioned and make able to be extruded. It was also pretty hard to get the right weights for the swing arm. I ended up getting help from class mates who helped me get the correct dimensions and weight.
